puts(9 / 2)

# Output:
#   4
# ABove code outputs 4 as integrer as both numbers are integers



# If both or just one of the franction numbers are in floating point,
# then the  output would be a floating point number

puts(9.0 / 2)
puts(9 / 2.0)

# Output:
#   4.5
#   4.5


# If you have two integers, you can also write:

puts(9.fdiv(2))

# Output:
#   4.5
